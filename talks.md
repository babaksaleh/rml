## Upcoming Schedule

| Date | Person | Information |
| ---  | ---  | --- |
| October 26th | Shaojun Zhu | **Recent applications of deep learning in robotics<br>(Perhaps focusing on grasping)**  <br> Some relevant papers: [[1]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3592.pdf)[[2]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3128)[[3]](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/PAPERS/iros15_grasp_varley.pdf)[[4]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06825v1.pdf)[[5]](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00702v3.pdf).  <br>[1-4] are on detecting grasping locations for robots using deep learning.  The last one for Pieter Abbeel's group in Berkeley is more interesting in the sense that it tries to learn control policies directly from visual input.  His group is one of the first advocates for deep learning in robotics and has a series of related work.  I have not read about it in details, so I may not cover it this time. |
| November 2nd | Dong Yang | |
| November 9th | Yan Zhu | **RNN and memory network**<br>I will basically go over these two excellent blogs: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrew Karpathy and [Understanding LSTM networks](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah. Then will cover my understanding for the memory networks (see the reference paper below). | 
| November 16th | Brian McMahan | **Reinforcement Learning with Neural Nets**<br>I will discuss the recent improvements of neural networks and reinfrocement learning. Specifically, I will go over [Willians (1992)](http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf) who introduced the REINFORCE algorithms for combining reinforcement learnign with neural network backpropagation.  This is the algorithm that underlies the model of [Minh, Heess, Graves, and Kavukcuoglu (2014)](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5542-recurrent-models-of-visual-attention.pdf): Recurrent Models of Visual Attention. If there is time or interest, I will also talk about [Deep-Q learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf). I can also do an overview of RL if there is interest. |
| November 23rd | Babak Saleh | "Large-scale Classification of Fine-Art Paintings: Learning The Right Metric on The Right Feature". In this talk I will go through some basics of "Metric Learning" and their applications in my research on analysis of fine-art paintings.|
| November 30th | Amr Bakry | |
| December 7th | Chetan Tonde | "Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep?" and "A new learning paradigm: Learning using privileged information" related papers presented together.|

## Rules

1. Members of the reading group will take turns presenting a paper or their own work to the group
2. There are no 'bystander' attendees.  
3. Presenting a paper does not have to be an immense endeavor.  Reading a paper and telling the group what it is about is necessary and sufficient.

### FAQ
1. How is the presenters' order generated?
    - The presenters' order is generated from the member list in a FIFO manner. 
2. Who is responsible if I can not present at the schedule time?
    - Yourself.  
3. What should I do if I can not present at the scheduled time?
    - First, let the organizer know your situation, as early as possible.  Second, contact other presenters on the list and see if they are willing to swap with you.
4. What happens if a new event takes place and we have to change the schedule?
    - To minimize disturbance, the conflicted spot will be moved to the rear of the list after confirmed with the original presenter, while all other schedules remain unchanged.  
5. How do I do X?
    - [There is a how to page](http://ada.cs.rutgers.edu/howto.html)
